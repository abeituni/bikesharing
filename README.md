### Overiew of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze bike rental durations, frequency of rentals throughout a certain period of time & gender information. 

### Results
Throughout the week, 8am and 5-6pm were when the highest frequency of trips occured. On weekends however, they were much more spread out during the entire day. Male customers took many more trips than female and unknown customers. Most customers are young adults with ages ranging between 25-40.

### Summary
In conclusion, we can infer most customers use these citibikes for daily transportation when going to and leaving work. One thing we can look in to further is hotspot locations for starting/ending rentals. We can also look into the consistency between subscribers and customers.
